You can use the [Geocoding-Util](https://github.com/JensOstertag/geocoding-util) library's `Geocoding` class to convert an address to coordinates or coordinates to an address. The library uses the [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) API to do that.

To learn about how to do that, please refer to the [Geocoding-Util documentation](https://github.com/JensOstertag/php-geocoding) as it always reflects the latest version of the library.
