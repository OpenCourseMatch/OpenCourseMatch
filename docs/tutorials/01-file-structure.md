# File structure
Before you start working with the framework and developing your project, it's important to understand the file structure. This will help you find the files that you are looking for.

## Root directory
The root directory contains the following files and subdirectories:
- `📁 .github/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `📁 docker/` - Docker files which are mounted into the image when building it
- `📁 docs/` - Documentation files for the framework (can be deleted or modified)
- [`📁 framework/`](#framework-directory)
- [`📁 htdocs/`](#htdocs-directory)
- [`📁 project/`](#project-directory)
- [`📁 secrets/`](#secrets-directory)
- `📁 tests/` - Test files for the framework and for your project
- `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore`
- `composer.json` - Defines required packages
- `Dockerfile` - Docker file for building the image
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker compose file for running the image
- `README.md` - Framework README (can be deleted or modified)

### Framework directory
The `📁 framework/` directory contains all files that are required by the framework itself and your project. If you're working on a project, it's recommended not to edit the files in this directory in order to keep compatibility with newer versions.

There are the following files and subdirectories:
- `📁 config/`
    - `Config.class.php` - Predefined configurable variables and parameters
- `📁 src/` - The frameworks source code
    - `📁 dao/` - Predefined DAO classes for predefined objects
    - `📁 lib/` - Libraries of the framework that aren't used often in the frameworks code
    - `📁 object/` - Predefined objects that can be used with the data access object pattern
- `📄 framework.php` - The primary framework file that imports all necessary files

### htdocs directory
The `📁 htdocs/` directory contains all files that are directly accessible via the web server.

There are the following files and subdirectories:
- `📁 deployment/` - Files that are used for the automatic deployment of the project
- `📁 static/` - Static files that are used in the frontend, such as CSS, JavaScript and images
- `.htaccess` - Apache configuration file that redirects all requests to the `📁 htdocs/routes-handler.php` file, except for requests to the `📁 htdocs/static/` directory
- `routes-handler.php` - PHP script that handles all requests to the web server and redirects them to the correct PHP script in the `📁 project/htdocs/` directory

### Project directory
The `📁 project/` directory contains most PHP files of your project.

There are the following files and subdirectories:
- `📁 config/`
    - `app-config.php` - Basic project settings
    - `app-routes.php` - Routes initialization
- `📁 cronjobs/` - Regularly executed (PHP) scripts
- `📁 frontend/` - BladeOne template files that are used to display the frontend
- `📁 htdocs/` - PHP script files that are accessible via routes defined in `📁 project/config/app-routes.php`
- `📁 src/` - Source code for your project that can be used in the `📁 project/htdocs/` directory
    - `📁 dao/` - DAO classes that are used in your project
    - `📁 lib/` - Additional libraries that are used in your project
    - `📁 object/` - Objects that are used in your project. Composer packages are installed in this directory.
    - `📁 schema/` - Database schema files that contain the code which is necessary to (re-)create the database infrastructure (tables, views, triggers, ...)
- `📁 template-cache/` - BladeOne template cache directory
- `📁 translations/` - Translation files for the project

### Secrets directory
The `📁 secrets/` directory contains all files that are required for the project to work, but shouldn't be committed to the repository. Files that end with `.example` are not ignored.

There are the following files and subdirectories:
- `config.secret.json` - Secret project settings or keys
- `config.secret.json.example` - Example file for `config.secret.json` that can be committed to the repository
