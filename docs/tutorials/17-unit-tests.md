# Unit tests
The framework uses the [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) framework to perform unit tests. The tests are located in the `📁 tests/` directory. They can be executed by running
```sh
composer run test
```
or are automatically executed by the GitHub Action pipeline on every push to the `main` branch.
