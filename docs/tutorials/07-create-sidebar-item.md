# Create a sidebar item
The sidebar menu items can be adjusted to your needs by modifying the `ðŸ“„ project/frontend/components/layout/sidebar.blade.php` file. By default, it contains an `<ul>` with an entry for the index page already defined. You can simply copy and paste the existing entry and adjust it to your needs.

You can also change the sidebars contents completely by adding your own HTML code.
